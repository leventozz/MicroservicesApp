# MicroservicesApp

I developed an small application with event-driven architecture and I used RabbitMQ as event bus. I have three microservices and one api gateway.
Api gateway is used to forward requests to microservices. Microservices communicate among themselves via the event bus.

I used Redis, MsSql, MongoDb, RabbitMQ, CQRS, Ocelot, DDD.
